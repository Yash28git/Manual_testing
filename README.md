## 1. Unit Testing  
**"Testing individual parts of the software"**

- **What it is:**  
  Unit testing focuses on testing **individual units or components** of the software (like a function or method in the code) to make sure each one works correctly in isolation.

- **Who does it:**  
  Developers usually perform unit tests.

- **When it's done:**  
  Itâ€™s done during the **development phase**, right after writing the code for a small part.

- **Goal:**  
  To ensure that **individual components** (e.g., functions, methods) of the software behave as expected.

- **Example:**  
  Testing a function that calculates the **total price of items** in a shopping cart.

---

## 2. Integration Testing  
**"Testing how different parts of the software work together"**

- **What it is:**  
  Integration testing checks if multiple parts of the software **work together as a group**. After unit tests confirm individual pieces work, integration testing ensures they interact as expected.

- **Who does it:**  
  Developers or testers typically perform integration testing.

- **When it's done:**  
  After unit testing, once components are **integrated together**.

- **Goal:**  
  To check if the **modules or components** of the system interact properly and the system works as a whole.

- **Example:**  
  Testing if the **payment processing system** communicates correctly with the **shopping cart** and **inventory system**.

---

## 3. System Testing  
**"Testing the entire system as a whole"**

- **What it is:**  
  System testing is the process of testing the **entire software as a complete system** to ensure all parts work together as expected in real-world conditions.

- **Who does it:**  
  **Testers** typically perform system testing.

- **When it's done:**  
  After integration testing and once all components have been **integrated into a complete system**.

- **Goal:**  
  To verify that the software meets the **specified requirements** and works as expected in all areas.

- **Example:**  
  Testing the entire **e-commerce website** to ensure users can browse, add items to the cart, and complete a checkout process.

---

## 4. Acceptance Testing  
**"Testing if the software meets the user's needs"**

- **What it is:**  
  Acceptance testing is done to determine if the software is **ready for release** and if it meets the **user's needs and requirements**. It checks whether the software satisfies the **business requirements** set at the start of the project.

- **Who does it:**  
  Typically, the **customer or business representatives** perform this testing. Sometimes, the **testing team** also helps.

- **When it's done:**  
  After system testing, typically just **before the software is released** to production.

- **Goal:**  
  To verify that the software is ready for **real-world use** and meets **user expectations**.

- **Example:**  
  The customer tests an **e-commerce application** to ensure the entire shopping process, including **payment, shipping, and order confirmation**, meets their business requirements.
#  QA Testing Activities

Quality Assurance (QA) involves a series of structured activities to ensure software quality throughout the development lifecycle. These activities focus on **preventing defects** and improving the **processes** used to create software.

---

## 1. Requirement Review

- Understand and analyze **requirements** (what the software should do)
- Identify any **gaps, conflicts, or unclear points**
- Ensure requirements are **testable** and **complete**

---

## 2. Test Planning

- Define **scope**, **approach**, **resources**, and **schedule** of testing
- Identify **testing tools**, **team responsibilities**, and **test environments**
- Create a **Test Plan** document

---

## 3. Test Case Design

- Write detailed **test cases** and **test scenarios** based on requirements
- Ensure coverage of both **functional** and **non-functional** areas
- Create necessary **test data** for executing the tests

---

## 4. Test Environment Setup

Prepare the environment where testing will be conducted:

- Set up **servers**
- Configure **databases**
- Install required **test tools**
- Establish and verify **network setup**
